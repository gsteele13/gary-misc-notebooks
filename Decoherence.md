# A qubit coupled to a 1-qubit environment


Start with environment in a definite state:

```python
sigmaz_q = tensor(sigmaz(), identity(2)) # the qubit
sigmaz_1 = tensor(identity(2), sigmaz()) # the first environment spin
H = 1.0 * sigmaz_q * sigmaz_1

psi0_qubit = (basis(2,0) + basis(2,1)).unit()
psi0_env = basis(2,0)

psi0 = tensor(psi0_qubit, psi0_env)

t = np.linspace(0,10,100)
result = sesolve(H, psi0, t)
psi = result.states

rho_qubit = [ptrace(k,0) for k in psi]

rho12 = expect(projection(2,0,1), rho_qubit)
plt.plot(np.real(rho12))
plt.plot(np.imag(rho12))
```

This one is just boring: it is just a shift in the qubit frequency. 


Now try environment in a superposition. This should be interesting as it it will induce a "quantum uncertainty" in the qubit frequency, in some sense

```python
sigmaz_q = tensor(sigmaz(), identity(2)) # the qubit
sigmaz_1 = tensor(identity(2), sigmaz()) # the first environment spin
H = 1.0 * sigmaz_q * sigmaz_1

psi0_qubit = (basis(2,0) + basis(2,1)).unit()
psi0_env = (basis(2,0) + basis(2,1)).unit()

psi0 = tensor(psi0_qubit, psi0_env)

t = np.linspace(0,10,100)
result = sesolve(H, psi0, t)
psi = result.states

rho_qubit = [ptrace(k,0) for k in psi]

rho12 = expect(projection(2,0,1), rho_qubit)
plt.plot(np.real(rho12))
plt.plot(np.imag(rho12))
```

```python
make_animation(rho_qubit)
```

Of course, it has no effect on the basis states: this is why pointer states do not decohere!

```python
sigmaz_q = tensor(sigmaz(), identity(2)) # the qubit
sigmaz_1 = tensor(identity(2), sigmaz()) # the first environment spin
H = 1.0 * sigmaz_q * sigmaz_1

psi0_qubit = (basis(2,0)).unit()
psi0_env = (basis(2,0) + basis(2,1)).unit()

psi0 = tensor(psi0_qubit, psi0_env)

t = np.linspace(0,10,100)
result = sesolve(H, psi0, t)
psi = result.states

rho_qubit = [ptrace(k,0) for k in psi]
make_animation(rho_qubit)
```

# A qubit coupled to a two-qubit environment

```python
sigmaz_q = tensor(sigmaz(), identity(2), identity(2)) # the qubit
sigmaz_1 = tensor(identity(2), sigmaz(), identity(2)) # the first environment spin
sigmaz_2 = tensor(identity(2), identity(2), sigmaz()) 

# With different coupling rates of course
H = 1.0 * sigmaz_q * sigmaz_1 + 0.6 * sigmaz_q * sigmaz_2

psi0_qubit = (basis(2,0) + basis(2,1)).unit()
psi0_env1 = (basis(2,0) + basis(2,1)).unit()
psi0_env2 = (basis(2,0) + basis(2,1)).unit()

psi0 = tensor(psi0_qubit, psi0_env1, psi0_env2)

t = np.linspace(0,10,100)
result = sesolve(H, psi0, t)
psi = result.states

rho_qubit = [ptrace(k,0) for k in psi]
```

```python
make_animation(rho_qubit)
```

```python
plt.plot(t, expect(sigmax(), rho_qubit))
plt.axhline(0,ls=":",c='grey')
```

Adding more of these will result in the exponential supression of coherence discussed by Zurek in the review article: 

Decoherence, einselection, and the quantum origins of the classical <br>

It also also the same origin of other apparent non-unitary evolution in a coherent thermodynamic limit. I wrote a term paper about this years ago at MIT (you can find it [here](https://zenodo.org/records/5732307) if you are interested), and was recently explore numerically by a group of students in the course TN3156 "Quantum Sensing and Measurement": 

https://nsweb.tn.tudelft.nl/~gsteele/misc/QSM_Project_Unitary_Exponential%20Decay.html

If we scale up the size of the environment, with a random distribution of couplings, and a random distribution of initial states, we should be able to see a convergence to an exponential suppression of coherence of superposition states of the environment.
